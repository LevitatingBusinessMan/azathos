# Real Linux From Scratch
RLFS is an operating system based on the Linux kernel created from scratch.
I started this project to get a better understanding of the Linux kernel itself.
My goal is to create a usable UNIX environment with my own init, shell and utilities.

## Building
```SHELL
make
make run
```
