# Real Linux From Scratch
RLFS is userland for Linux written from scratch.
I started this project to get a better understanding of the Linux kernel itself.
My goal is to create a usable UNIX environment with my own init, shell and utilities.

All code is written in Rust using just a few common libraries like libc, rand, chrono and serde.

## Building
```SHELL
make
make run
```
